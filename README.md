# CT Scan Software
Built for a university graphics algorithms module, we take data from a CT Scan and turn it into readable images for medical staff to diagnose. 
I chose to use Java with JavaFX2. 
Features:
* Histogram Equalisation
* Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)
* Nearest neighbour & bilinear interpolation scaling
* Thumnail view for viewing all "slices"
